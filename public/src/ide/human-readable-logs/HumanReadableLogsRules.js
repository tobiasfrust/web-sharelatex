You have placed an alignment tab character '&' in the wrong place. If you want to align something, you must write it inside an align environment such as \\begin{align} \u2026 \\end{align}, \\begin{tabular} \u2026 \\end{tabular}, etc. If you want to write an ampersand '&' in text, you must write \\& instead.\

    humanReadableHint: `\
You have forgotten a $ sign at the end of 'display math' mode. When writing in display math mode, you must always math write inside $$ \u2026 $$. Check that the number of $s match around each math expression.\

    extraInfoURL: 'https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Errors/Missing_$_inserted',
    humanReadableHint: `\
Check that your $'s match around math expressions. If they do, then you've probably used a symbol in normal text that needs to be in math mode. Symbols such as subscripts ( _ ), integrals ( \\int ), Greek letters ( \\alpha, \\beta, \\delta ), and modifiers (\\vec{x}, \\tilde{x} ) must be written in math mode. See the full list <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Errors/Missing_$_inserted \">here</a>.If you intended to use mathematics mode, then use $ \u2026 $ for 'inline math mode', $$ \u2026 $$ for 'display math mode' or alternatively \\begin{math} \u2026 \\end{math}.\

    humanReadableHint: `\
The float specifier 'h' is too strict of a demand for LaTeX to place your float in a nice way here. Try relaxing it by using 'ht', or even 'htbp' if necessary. If you want to try keep the float here anyway, check out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Positioning_of_Figures\">float package</a>.\

    humanReadableHint: `\
You have forgotten to include a float specifier, which tells LaTeX where to position your figure. To fix this, either insert a float specifier inside the square brackets (e.g. \\begin{figure}[h]), or remove the square brackets (e.g. \\begin{figure}).

You have used a font command which is only available in math mode. To use this command, you must be in maths mode (E.g. $ \u2026 $ or \\begin{math} \u2026 \\end{math}). If you want to use it outside of math mode, use the text version instead: \\textrm, \\textit, etc.\
